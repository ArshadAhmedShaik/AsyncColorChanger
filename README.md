# Async Color Changer

A tiny web project that changes the page background color asynchronously when you click the button.

This repository contains a minimal HTML/CSS/JavaScript demo. It’s intended for learning and experimentation.

## Files
- `index.html` — main HTML file with a heading, a color display area, and a button.
- `script.js` — JavaScript that handles asynchronous color changes when the button is clicked.
- `style.css` — basic styling and fonts used by the demo.

## How to run
1. Open the project folder in your file explorer.
2. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.

Alternatively, from PowerShell you can run:

```powershell
Start-Process .\index.html
```

Or if you use VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live" to serve the page.

## Usage
- Click the "Click Me" button on the page to trigger the asynchronous color change.

## How to modify
- Edit `style.css` to change layout and fonts.
- Edit `script.js` to change the color generation or the way the async flow behaves.

## Notes
- No build steps or dependencies required — this is plain HTML/CSS/JS.
- Works entirely in the browser.
